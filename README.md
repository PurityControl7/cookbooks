*Cybersecurity cookbooks: unleashing mayhem through trial and error.*

This workspace contains various small scripts, techniques, research and educational tidbits that I find particularly interesting or useful (mostly by studying books and other materials). The main goal of this repository is to document and track my learning journey in the field of cybersecurity, as well as to share information with others who might be interested in something like this.

Also, I always try to give credit where it's due to show respect for any sources I am using in my research. Please feel free to contact me if you believe I have inadvertently omitted mentioning this kind of information.

**Note:** I apologize if the classification and categorization of the content might not be "better" or more structured. Please keep in mind that this repository is primarily for my personal use, and the organization reflects my own internal logic and preferences.
